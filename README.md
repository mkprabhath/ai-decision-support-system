# AI Decision Support System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple AI-based Decision Support System built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js**.  
It helps users make a decision based on **Demand, Cost, and Risk** values.

The system processes inputs and returns a recommendation such as:
- Proceed
- Reconsider
- Do Not Proceed

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- User enters values for:
  - Demand (0–10)
  - Cost (0–10)
  - Risk (0–10)
- The backend evaluates the inputs using a rule-based decision logic.
- A decision is returned and displayed on the UI.
